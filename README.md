- ‚úÖ View pods in wide format (IP, Node, Status) (`kpods`)
- ‚úÖ Tail logs of the latest pod matching a name (`kf`)
- ‚úÖ Open a shell inside a pod (`ksh`)
- ‚úÖ List ingress domains and paths (`kingress`)
- ‚úÖ Detect crash or image pull errors in pods (`kcrash`)
- ‚úÖ Search within ConfigMaps and Secrets (`kfind`)
- ‚úÖ List top pods by CPU usage (`ktop`)
- ‚úÖ Show the most recently created pod (`knewest`)
- ‚úÖ Switch between Kubernetes contexts (`kctx`)
- ‚úÖ Change namespace in current context (`kns`)
- ‚úÖ List all deployments across namespaces (`kdeploys`)
- ‚úÖ Monitor rollout status of a deployment (`krollout`)
- ‚úÖ Port-forward pod to localhost (`kportfwd`)
- ‚úÖ List all container images used in deployments (`kimg`)
- ‚úÖ Launch a temporary BusyBox pod for debugging (`kdebug`)
- ‚úÖ Clean up completed or evicted pods (`kclean`)
- ‚úÖ Execute a command inside a pod (`kexec`)
- ‚úÖ View Kubernetes node info and resource capacity (`knodes`)
- ‚úÖ Annotate a resource (`kannotate`)
- ‚úÖ Compare live deployment YAML with a local manifest (`kdiff`)
- ‚úÖ Backup full cluster resources and Helm releases (`kbackup`)
- ‚úÖ Restore from cluster resource and Helm manifest backups (`krestore`)

## üì¶ Installation

You can add this utility set to your machine with a simple `curl` command:

```bash
curl -o ~/.kube-utils.zsh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isimtekin/kube-utils/main/.kube-utils.zsh
echo 'source ~/.kube-utils.zsh' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'alias kube-utils-update="curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isimtekin/kube-utils/main/.kube-utils.zsh -o ~/.kube-utils.zsh && source ~/.kube-utils.zsh"'  >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You need to have `kubectl` and `column` installed. Most systems already have `column`. Optionally, you can install `jq` for extended features.

## üß™ Usage

```bash
kservices [namespace]             # List services with their URLs and ports
kpods [namespace]                 # Show pods with wide output
kf <namespace> <name-pattern>     # Tail logs of latest pod matching pattern
ksh <namespace> <pod-name>        # Start shell inside a pod
kingress                          # Show ingress domain and path mappings
kcrash                            # List pods in error or crash loop
kfind <configmap|secret> <kw>    # Search inside ConfigMaps or Secrets
ktop                              # Show top 10 pods by CPU
knewest [namespace]               # Most recently created pod
kctx                              # Show current context and list all
kns <namespace>                   # Change the active namespace
kdeploys                          # List all deployments across namespaces
krollout <deployment> [ns]        # Watch rollout status of a deployment
kportfwd <ns> <name> <lport> <rport> # Port forward a pod to localhost
kimg                              # List all images used in deployments
kdebug                            # Launch temporary BusyBox pod for debugging
kclean                            # Clean up completed and evicted pods
kexec <ns> <pod> <cmd>            # Execute command in a pod
knodes                            # Show node info and resource capacity
kannotate <res> <name> <k> <v>    # Add or update annotation on a resource
kdiff <ns> <deployment>           # Diff live deployment with local manifest
kbackup                            # Backup all namespaces, resources, and Helm manifests
krestore <path>                    # Restore Kubernetes resources and Helm manifests from backup
```

All commands are namespace-aware and safe to run.
